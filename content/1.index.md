Welcome to Pro Forma Futures!

Pro Forma Futures ("PFF") is a non-profit organization dedicated to enhancing diversity in the finance and consulting sectors. We connect candidates from underrepresented groups--including women, people of color, LGBTQIA+ individuals, and those from diverse backgrounds--with a range of post-graduate opportunities. Our mission extends to providing continuous support as these candidates navigate their career paths.

For those eyeing a career in investment banking, private equity, private credit, sales & trading, research, corporate finance, wealth management, or consulting, the PFF team is here to guide you. We can enlighten you about the role, help build your network, and importantly, teach you how to excel during the recruitment process.

The PFF Team consists of young professionals from various roles in the finance and consulting industries. We offer insights and advice that are traditionally hard to access. Having recently gone through the recruitment process ourselves, we understand the essential "blocking-and-tackling" aspects that more senior professionals might overlook. Many of us are also involved in conducting interviews for our employers, providing us with a unique perspective on the candidate evaluation process.
